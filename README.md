# gRNA
Guide RNA desigh for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing


This Python package identifies candidate guide RNA for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing based on the NGG structure of gRNA, then aligns those sequences to the reference genome and scores them based on the alignment. Next, the package reads the provided gff3 file and annotates the gRNA based on this information. The final output includes the location, strand, annotation, and score of each candidate gRAN.
